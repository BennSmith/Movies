# About
This project was created as part of a web design course I took in my third year of college.  We were given a csv containing information about various movies at a movie theater.  From that we had to create a webpage for a movie theater that displayed the information about each of the movies.  The final project can be found here: http://bensmith.xyz/movies/index.php.
